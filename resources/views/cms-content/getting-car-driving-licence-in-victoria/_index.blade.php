                    <h3 class="universal-title">Steps from learner to full licence</h3>
                    <p>There are 4 steps to progress from a learner to a full licence:</p>
                    <ul class="list-styles start0">
                        <li class="top10"><i class="fa blue-circle">1</i>Getting learner's permit</li>
                        <li><i class="fa blue-circle">2</i>Getting provisional licence (p1)</li>
                        <li><i class="fa blue-circle">3</i>Getting provisional licence (p2)</li>
                        <li><i class="fa blue-circle">4</i>Getting full licence </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="universal-title">Getting learner's permit</h3>
                    <p>A car learner permit allows you to drive a car on the road with an
                        experienced driver while you are learning to drive. Find out how to
                        get your learner permit and access the online practice learner permit knowledge test.</p>
                    <p>If youâ€™re 16 or older and live in Victoria, you can apply to get your car learner permit.
                        You have to pay and pass the learner permit knowledge test to get a learner's permit.</p>
                    <h3 class="universal-title">Getting provisional licence</h3>
                    <p>If you have learner's permit and have practised a certain number of hours,
                        you are eligible to get your provisional licence.  You must be at least 18
                        years of age and a Victorian resident to be eligible to apply for a probationary
                        driver licence.  If you are under the age of 21, have completed and recorded in
                        your learner log book a minimum of 120 hours of supervised driving, including at
                        least 10 hours at night (unless an exemption has been granted) and hold a current
                        car learner permit for a continuous minimum period immediately before applying for
                        a driver licence (unless an exemption from this requirement has been granted), you
                        can take a Hazard perception test and driving test. After passing those test,
                        you will get your provisional licence.</p>
